# HCI Page Ruler

Page Ruler is an add-on that lets you measure distances (in pixels) on a webpage and calculate [Fitts's index of difficulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitts%27s_law) (ID).

It draws a rectangular ruler when you move your mouse on the page. The ruler has width, height, start and end labeled with corresponding metrics in pixels. When you move your mouse, the rectangle changes its size and all the numerics are updated, also the first page element below cursor is selected in order to calculate ID. To activate the addon press the toolbar button once. Likewise, to disable the addon press the toolbar button again. Mouse, position adjustment with keyboard and touch-enabled devices are supported.
